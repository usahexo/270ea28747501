#  How to Win Money Playing Blackjack in Aruba by Casino.org

If you're looking to have some fun and potentially win some money while on vacation in Aruba, look no further than the blackjack tables. Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games in the world, and Aruba is no exception - in fact, there are several casinos on the island that offer blackjack tables.

Blackjack is a relatively simple game to learn but can be quite complex to master. The goal of the game is to draw cards that total 21 or as close to 21 as possible without going over, while also not losing to the dealer by busting. Each player is dealt two cards face up, and the dealer is dealt two cards face down (one face up). Players can either hit (take another card) or stand (take no more cards). The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over; if your total exceeds 21, you bust and lose automatically.

If you're playing at a casino in Aruba, it's important to know which variation of blackjack they are playing. In most cases, they will be playing Las Vegas rules, which means that players can double down (double their bet and receive one more card) after splitting pairs and can also split pairs (split their two cards into two separate hands) up to three times for a total of four hands. Some casinos may use other variations of blackjack rules, so it's important to ask what the rules are before sitting down at a table.

Now that you know how to play blackjack, it's time to learn some basic strategy for winning. The first thing you want to do when playing blackjack is figure out what your basic strategy tells you to do. Basic strategy takes into account your hand total and the dealers upcard to tell you the best way to play each hand. You can find basic strategy charts online or in books at most bookstores. Once you have your basic strategy chart memorized, follow it closely - it will give you the best chance of winning at the table.

In addition to following your basic strategy chart closely, there are a few other tips that can help increase your chances of winning when playing blackjack in Aruba:

-Don't take unnecessary risks: This may seem like common sense, but many players make the mistake of trying too hard to win big amounts of money quickly by taking risks they normally wouldn't take. This often leads to them making bad decisions and losing money in the long run. Slow and steady wins the race when it comes to gambling - so don't go overboard with your wagers.

-Know when to fold: Just like in any other type of gambling game, there will be times when you should just fold and walk away from the table. If your hand isn't good and there's no way for you to improve it, then it's best to just cut your losses and move on. There's no shame in folding - after all, Lady Luck isn't always on your side.

-Take advantage of bonuses: Most casinos offer players bonuses for signing up or making a certain amount of wagers. Make sure you take advantage of these bonuses - they can give you a little extra boost at the table and increase your chances of walking away a winner.

Blackjack is a fun and exciting casino game that can be enjoyed by players of all levels of experience. If you're planning on vacationing in Aruba this year, be sure to check out one of the casinos offering blackjack tables - who knows, maybe Lady Luck will be on your side and you'll walk away a winner!

#  Winning at Blackjack in Aruba: Strategies for Every Player by Travel + Leisure

In Aruba, the casinos are always hopping, especially with blackjack tables. The game is popular for a reason: It's simple to play and a lot of fun. But if you're looking to win at blackjack while in Aruba, it's important to understand the basics and employ some winning strategies.

First and foremost, know the rules of the game. Blackjack is played with six decks, and each player is dealt two cards face down. The goal is to beat the dealer's hand by either getting as close to 21 as possible or by getting more points than the dealer without going over 21. Cards two through 10 are worth their face value, and an ace can be worth either one or eleven points. Face cards (jacks, queens and kings) are all worth ten points.

Once you understand the rules, it's time to start strategizing. Here are four tips for winning at blackjack in Aruba:

1) Don't over-bet your hand - In blackjack, it's important to strike a balance between risking too much and not risking enough. If you bet too much on any one hand, you could quickly lose all your money - and no one wants that! Instead, try betting smaller amounts on each hand and never bet more than half of your total bankroll. This way, you'll still have money left if you do happen to lose a few hands in a row.

2) Hit on 16 or less - When you're dealt two cards that add up to 16 or less (i.e. an eight and an eight), always hit - even if the dealer is showing a low card (six or lower). By hitting when you have 16 or less points, you increase your chances of getting closer to 21 without going over (a so-called "soft 17").


3) Double down on 11 - When you're dealt an 11 point hand (two cards totalling eleven), double down! This move increases your chance of winning by giving yourself another card that could help make 21 - or beat the dealer's hand if they've got less than 21 points.

4) Stand on 17 or more - On the other hand, when you're dealt two cards totaling 17 or more (like an ace and a six), always stand pat! This will give you the best chance of beating the dealer without going over 21 yourself.
