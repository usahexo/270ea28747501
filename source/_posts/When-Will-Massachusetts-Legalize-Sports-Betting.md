#  When Will Massachusetts Legalize Sports Betting?

The Massachusetts Gaming Commission (MGC) is currently in the process of drafting regulations for legalized sports betting in the state. The MGC will hold a public hearing on the proposed regulations on Wednesday, September 26th.

The MGC has not yet announced a timeline for when sports betting will be legalized in Massachusetts, but it is likely that it will happen sometime in 2019.

As of now, only three states – New Jersey, Delaware, and West Virginia – have legalized sports betting since the Supreme Court overturned the federal ban on sports betting in May.

There are a few potential stumbling blocks that could delay the legalization of sports betting in Massachusetts. First, there is resistance from some lawmakers who believe that gambling can lead to addiction and social ills. Second, there are concerns about how to protect the integrity of sporting events given the potential for match-fixing.

Despite these potential roadblocks, there is sentiment among lawmakers that sports betting should be legalized in order to generate new revenue for the state. In addition, there is already a robust illegal sports betting market in Massachusetts worth an estimated $500 million per year. Legalizing sports betting would allow the state to tap into this market and generate additional tax revenue.

#  When Will Massachusetts Join the Growing List of States to Legalize Sports Betting?

Since the Supreme Court overturned a 1992 federal law prohibiting sports betting, Massachusetts has been exploring the possibility of legalizing the activity. Massachusetts Gaming Commission Chairman Steven Crosby said in May that the commission would not rule out sports betting, but no decisions have been made yet.

There is a lot of money at stake. The American Gaming Association estimates that Americans illegally bet $150 billion on sports each year. That number could jump if gambling is legalized and regulated.

One potential issue is how to handle gambling addiction. While other forms of gambling are legal in Massachusetts, lawmakers will need to ensure that any regulations around sports betting protect players from addiction.

Another concern is whether legalizing sports betting will cannibalize revenues from the state's existing casino industry. The state's six casinos brought in more than $1 billion in revenue last year, so it's certainly something legislators will want to consider.

So far, only a handful of states have legalized sports betting since the Supreme Court's decision in May. These include Delaware, New Jersey, Mississippi, West Virginia, and Rhode Island. More states are expected to follow suit in the coming months and years.

It remains to be seen whether Massachusetts will join this growing list of states to legalize sports betting. But there are certainly many factors legislators will need to consider before making a decision.

#  Bills Pushing to Legalize Sports Betting in Massachusetts Headed for a Showdown?

The Massachusetts state legislature has been busy this year trying to legalize sports betting in the state. A bill was introduced in the House of Representatives in February and a similar measure was brought before the Senate in May.

Both bills would establish a commission to regulate sports betting in Massachusetts, authorizing the licensing of operators and regulating the industry. The Senate bill would also impose a 10 percent tax on gambling revenues.

So far, there hasn’t been much movement on either bill, but they could be headed for a showdown as lawmakers wrap up their work for the year.

Supporters of legalizing sports betting say it would bring new revenue to the state and create jobs. They also argue that it would help keep Massachusetts residents from taking their business to other states where sports betting is already legal.

Opponents worry that legalizing sports betting could lead to addiction and other social ills. They also question whether the state should be getting into the gambling business.

It remains to be seen whether either bill will pass before the end of the legislative session, but it seems likely that some form of legalized sports betting will eventually become law in Massachusetts.

#  Why Massachusetts Has Yet to Legalize Sports Betting

A little more than a year ago, the US Supreme Court overturned the federal ban on sports betting, giving states the opportunity to legalize it. Yet, Massachusetts has yet to do so.

There are a few reasons for this. For one, lawmakers have been preoccupied with other issues, such as marijuana legalization and ridesharing. Additionally, there is some concern that legalizing sports betting could lead to an increase in gambling addiction rates.

However, there is also a lot of money to be made from legalizing sports betting. In 2017, Americans illegally bet $150 billion on sports, and that number is only expected to grow now that sports betting is legal in more states. Legalizing sports betting in Massachusetts could bring in millions of dollars in tax revenue each year.

So why hasn't Massachusetts legalized sports betting yet? It's likely a combination of things: lawmakers are preoccupied with other issues, there is some concern about increased addiction rates, and there is potential for significant tax revenue. But it's also likely that lawmakers are waiting to see how other states implement sports betting before deciding what to do in Massachusetts.

#  Massachusetts Slowly Warming Up to the Idea of Legalized Sports Betting

It seems that Massachusetts is slowly warming up to the idea of legalized sports betting, as a new survey has found that a majority of residents in the state support it. According to the survey, which was conducted by WBUR and MassINC, 57 percent of residents said that they support legalizing sports betting, while only 33 percent said that they oppose it. Eleven percent of residents said that they were undecided on the issue.

This is a significant shift from previous polling on the issue, which showed that a majority of Massachusetts residents were opposed to legalizing sports betting. A poll from late last year showed that only 36 percent of residents supported legalization, while 49 percent were opposed. It’s worth noting that this latest poll was conducted before the Supreme Court overturned the federal ban on sports betting in May, so it’s possible that support for legalization has increased since then.

If Massachusetts does decide to legalize sports betting, it will join a growing number of states that have done so in recent months. Since the Supreme Court’s ruling in May, Delaware, Mississippi, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and West Virginia have all passed laws legalizing sports betting. The District of Columbia also legalized sports betting shortly after the Supreme Court’s ruling.

There are some who believe that Massachusetts could see significant revenue gains from legalizing sports betting. A study released last month by Oxford Economics estimated that legalized sports betting could generate between $265 million and $ attitudes about legalized gambling in Massachusetts appear to be changing, and it’s likely only a matter of time before lawmakers in the state take action on legalizing sports betting.
