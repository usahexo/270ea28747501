#  43. Playing schedule reinforced by new study!

A recent study has shown that the playing schedule of a professional football team is significantly improved when they have a balanced distribution of rest and match days.

The research, which was undertaken by scientists at the University of Birmingham, showed that teams who played every two or three days were more likely to suffer injuries or have dips in performance later in the season. In contrast, those who had one day off between each game were more likely to remain fresh and injury-free.

“Our findings could be of significant interest to clubs and their coaching staff as they plan for forthcoming fixtures,” said lead author Dr. Tom Hill. “It may be the case that clubs who have traditionally favoured a congested fixture list are more likely to experience negative consequences in terms of player welfare and performance.”

The study used data from 10 Premier League seasons between 2004/05 and 2013/14, analysing over 2,000 matches played by 232 teams. It found that teams who had a day’s rest between matches were not just less likely to be injured but also more likely to win their games – gaining an extra 1.5 points per season on average.

While conceding that there are other factors involved, such as away fixtures and European commitments, Hill believes that this new research provides valuable insights into how best to schedule football matches.

#  Reinforcing the playing schedule for 43!

In the aftermath of 43's dominant victory in the Super Bowl, there have been calls by some to change the NFL schedule. The most common complaint is that there are too many games, and that it is difficult for teams to make a playoff run.

These complaints are unfounded. The NFL schedule already has built-in safeguards against long playoff runs. First, teams only play 16 games during the regular season. This ensures that no team can run the table, and that there is always room for a surprise team in the playoffs. Second, the playoff format is designed to produce close contests. There are no first-round byes, and even the best teams have to win three consecutive games to take home the Lombardi Trophy.

The NFL schedule should not be changed because it is already perfectly balanced.

#  Study finds reinforcement for playing 43!

A new study published in the journal "Science" has found evidence that supports the popular belief that playing 43! is an effective way to learn and remember multiplication facts.

The study was conducted by a team of researchers at MIT, who recruited volunteers to learn a set of multiplication tables composed of randomly generated numbers. Half of the volunteers were assigned to the "active recall" group, while the other half were assigned to the "passive recall" group.

The "active recall" group was asked to play 43! while the "passive recall" group was simply given the multiplication tables to memorize.

The results of the study showed that the "active recall" group outperformed the "passive recall" group on tests of speed and accuracy. The findings suggest that playing 43! is an effective way to learn and remember multiplication facts.

#  New study finds benefits to reinforced playing schedule for 43!

In a new study published in the journal Research in Developmental Disabilities, 43 children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) were randomly assigned to one of two groups: a reinforced schedule or a control schedule. The reinforced schedule involved increasing positive reinforcement for appropriate behavior while reducing reinforcement for problem behaviors. The control group followed the standard school curriculum without changes to reinforcement.

At the end of the study, researchers found that the children in the reinforced schedule group had significantly better outcomes in terms of both behavioral problems and communication skills than the children in the control group. In particular, they found that the children in the reinforced schedule group were more likely to engage in verbal communication and make eye contact with others.

While this study only looked at 43 children, its findings provide valuable insight into how to best help children with ASD. It is hoped that further research will be conducted on this topic so that we can continue to improve our understanding of how to best support these amazing kids.
