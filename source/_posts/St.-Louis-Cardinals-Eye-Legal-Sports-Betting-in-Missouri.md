#  St. Louis Cardinals Eye Legal Sports Betting in Missouri

The St. Louis Cardinals are one of the most successful franchises in all of professional sports. The Cardinals have won 11 World Series championships and 19 National League pennants. However, the Cardinals have not been able to replicate their success on the field in recent years. The Cardinals have made the playoffs just two times in the past six seasons and have not won a playoff game since 2013.

While many people are pointing to the Cardinals’ struggles on the field as the reason for their decrease in popularity, there may be another reason for their woes. The Cardinals are one of five teams that does not have a legal sports betting operation in their home state. In fact, Missouri is one of just six states that does not have any legal form of sports betting. This lack of legal sports betting could be hurting the Cardinals, as they are unable to tap into a market that is estimated to be worth $150 billion annually.

Cardinals owner William DeWitt Jr. understands that legal sports betting could be a valuable addition to the team’s business portfolio and has been working to get a bill passed in Missouri that would legalize sports betting. DeWitt Jr. was able to get a hearing on his bill before the Missouri House Gaming Committee earlier this month and testified in favor of it.

If DeWitt Jr. is able to get his bill passed, it would mark a major victory for him and for the St. Louis Cardinals. Legal sports betting would give the team an additional revenue stream and could help them reclaim their spot as one of baseball’s elite teams.

#  Could Missouri Be The Next State To Legalize Sports Betting?

A number of states are considering legalizing sports betting in the wake of the Supreme Court’s ruling in May that struck down a federal law prohibiting most states from authorizing such gambling.

Missouri is one of those states. Legislation that would legalize and regulate sports betting was introduced in the state House of Representatives last week.

The bill, HB 2267, would allow wagering on professional and collegiate sporting events. It would also allow casinos, horse tracks, and other authorized gaming facilities to offer sports betting.

The Missouri Gaming Commission would be responsible for regulating sports betting in the state. The commission would have the authority to refuse or revoke a license to operate a sports betting facility, and to impose fines and other penalties for violating the law.

Proponents of legalizing sports betting in Missouri say it could generate millions of dollars in revenue for the state. They argue that it would be a boon to the state’s casino industry, and that it would create jobs.

Opponents of legalization say it could lead to addiction and other social problems. They also express concern about the possible impact on youth gambling rates.

So far there is no indication whether the bill will pass or not. But with more states moving to legalize sports betting, it’s likely only a matter of time before Missouri joins them.

#  Sports Betting Could Be A Reality In Missouri This Year

In May of this year, a new bill was brought to the Missouri state legislature that would legalize sports betting in the state. The state is one of only six in the US that does not have some form of legalized gambling, and this new bill could change all that.

The bill, known as House Bill no. HB 1919, would allow for both online and land-based sports betting in Missouri. It would also give the Missouri Gaming Commission the authority to regulate and license all sports betting operations in the state.

There is a lot of money at stake here, with some estimating that legalized sports betting could generate up to $200 million per year in revenue for the state of Missouri. This money would come from both taxing sports betting operations and from licensing fees charged to those who wish to offer sports betting services.

So far, it doesn’t look like there is much opposition to the bill, with many lawmakers indicating their support for it. It remains to be seen whether or not it will actually pass, but there is a good chance that it will. If it does, Missouri could soon become a major hotspot for sports betting.

#  Legalized Sports Betting Could Be Coming To Missouri

On Wednesday, February 21, 2018, Missouri lawmakers announced House Bill No. 2033 which would legalize sports betting in the state should the Supreme Court overturn the federal ban. Proponents of the bill feel that it would bring in much-needed revenue to the state, estimated at $200 million per year.

The Supreme Court is set to hear a case on Monday, March 26, 2018, called Christie v. National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) which could overturn the federal ban on sports betting known as the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 (PASPA). If overturned, each state would then be allowed to legalize sports betting within its borders.

Missouri's House Bill No. 2033 calls for a 10% tax on gaming revenues with 75% of those funds earmarked for education and 25% for problem gambling programs. The bill has bipartisan support with 36 sponsors in the House of Representatives.

Other states are also moving forward with legislation to legalize sports betting should PASPA be overturned including New Jersey, Mississippi, and West Virginia.

#  Missouri Poised To Legalize Sports Betting

The Missouri state legislature is considering a bill that would legalize sports betting in the state.

The proposed legislation would allow sports betting at casinos, racetracks, and other approved locations. It would also allow online and mobile sports betting.

Supporters of the bill say that it would provide much-needed revenue for the state. They also argue that it would create jobs and help to boost the economy.

Opponents of the bill argue that it could lead to addiction and other social problems. They also say that it would be difficult to regulate.

The Missouri state legislature is expected to vote on the bill in the coming weeks.
