#  How Much Tax Do I Owe on Slot Machine Winnings in New York?

If you hit it big at a casino in New York, you may be wondering how much tax you owe on your winnings. The good news is that New York does not have a state income tax. However, the bad news is that the federal government does impose taxes on gambling winnings.

In addition to federal taxes, you may also have to pay state and local taxes on your gambling winnings. For example, in Nevada, gambling winnings are subject to a state income tax rate of 6.9%. So, if you won $10,000 at a casino in Nevada, you would owe $690 in state taxes.

To figure out how much tax you owe on your gambling winnings, you will need to complete IRS Form 1040 Schedule E. This form asks for detailed information about your income and expenses, including your gambling winnings.
