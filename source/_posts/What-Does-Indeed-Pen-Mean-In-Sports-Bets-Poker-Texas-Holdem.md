#  What Does Indeed Pen Mean In Sports Bets Poker Texas Holdem?

Indeed, a poker player, after studying their opponent's actions and tendencies, might "put them on a hand" and then make a betting decision based on this estimation. For instance, if an opponent keeps raising before the flop, a player may put them on a strong hand like top pair or better.

In sports betting, "pen" is short for "penny," which is another name for a point spread. In most cases, the favorite in a sporting event will be given a number of points (the "penny") they are expected to win by. The underdog will have a negative number next to their name (e.g. -5.5), which reflects the number of points they are expected to lose by. So, in order to bet on the favorite, you would need to wager more than what your potential return is (odds of -110). To bet on the underdog, you would need to wager less than what your potential return is (odds of +100).

If you wanted to bet $11 on the favorite (by risking $120), and they won by exactly seven points, your payout would be $15.63—which is calculated by taking your original stake ($11) and multiplying it by the odds against you (-7/10) and then adding your original wager ($120). Conversely, if you wanted to bet $8 on the underdog (by risking only $80), and they lost by exactly seven points, your payout would be $10—which is calculated by taking your original stake ($8) and multiplying it by the odds against you (+7/10) and then subtracting your original wager ($80).
