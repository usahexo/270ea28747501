#  What is the story behind Curie?

Pierre and Marie Curie were a married couple who worked together to discover new elements. They are most well-known for their discovery of radium and polonium.

Marie was born in Paris, France in 1867. Pierre was born in the same city a few years later in 1859. They both attended college in Paris, and it was there that they met and started working together.

In 1898, they discovered polonium. A few months later, they discovered radium. At the time, no one knew what these new elements were or what they could be used for.

The Curies continued to study these elements and figure out their properties. They also developed a way to isolate radium so that it could be used in medical treatments.
