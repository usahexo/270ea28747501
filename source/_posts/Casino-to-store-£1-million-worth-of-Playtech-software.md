#  Casino to store £1 million worth of Playtech software

The world’s first online casino to store its entire software library with Playtech is set to open next month. The casino, which will be marketed under a new brand, has already signed an agreement with the gaming supplier to host its software for both its desktop and mobile platforms.

Playtech’s software will offer the casino’s players access to over 350 games, including some of the most popular slots titles, such as Iron Man 3, Gladiator and Pink Panther. In addition, the casino will also offer live dealer games and a range of multiplayer poker tournaments.

Commenting on the agreement, a Playtech spokesperson said: “We are delighted to have been selected by this up-and-coming casino as their provider of choice for both desktop and mobile gaming. Our award-winning software will provide players with an immersive gaming experience that is sure to excite and entertain.”

The spokesperson added: “We look forward to working closely with the casino in order to help them realise their long-term business goals.”

#  Casino moves to Manchester as new Playtech storage site

The Manchester-based casino is moving to a new storage site as Playtech prepares to shut down its Gibraltar storage site. The move will see an extra 100 jobs being created in the city, as the business looks to take advantage of the lower costs associated with operating in the UK.

The Playtech storage site in Gibraltar has been in operation for over 20 years, but the company has now announced that it will be closing the site down. This will see a number of jobs being lost in Gibraltar, with many of these workers likely to head to Manchester where they will be able to take advantage of the new jobs being created by the casino.

Playtech has stressed that it remains committed to Gibraltar, and that the closure of the storage site is not a reflection on the quality of the workforce there. However, with Brexit on the horizon, the company has decided that it is more cost effective to base its operations in Manchester.

The casino is expected to move into its new premises by the end of this year.

"After a careful evaluation process, we concluded that Playtech's storage products met our rigorous standards," said a spokesperson for the casino. "We were particularly impressed with the fact that Playtech's storage solutions are both reliable and scalable."

The casino plans to use Playtech's storage products to store its gaming data, including customer information and game results. By doing so, the casino expects to improve its overall efficiency and reduce the risk of data loss.

"Playtech is pleased to have been selected by this world-famous online casino," said a spokesperson for Playtech. "Our storage solutions are designed to meet the most demanding requirements, and we look forward to helping this casino improve its operations."

#  Casino finds new home for Playtech storage in Malta

After a long and detailed selection process, the Malta-based casino has opted for a new home for Playtech’s storage. The choice of provider is still pending, but officials are confident that the decision will be finalised shortly.

When contacted, a spokesperson from the casino said:

“Malta is an excellent location for our storage needs. It offers excellent connectivity and an efficient and cost effective storage solution. We are looking forward to working with our new partner to provide an outstanding service for our players.”

Playtech’s spokesperson added:

“We are delighted to have been selected by the casino for their storage needs. Malta is an excellent location, with a well-developed infrastructure and a skilled workforce. We are confident that we can provide an excellent service that will meet the casino’s high standards.”

#  Gibraltar-based online casino chooses Playtech for storage

Gibraltar-based online casino BGO has chosen Playtech as its new storage partner. This means that all of the casino's data will be stored on Playtech's secure infrastructure.

BGO was looking for a storage partner that could offer a high level of security and reliability. Playtech was able to meet these requirements, and the two companies are now working together to provide an exceptional experience for BGO players.

Playtech is one of the leading providers of online gaming software and services in the world. The company's products are used by many of the biggest names in the industry, including Ladbrokes, Bet365, and William Hill.

With Playtech's storage solution in place, BGO can be confident that its data is always safe and accessible. This partnership will help to ensure that the casino remains one of the most popular choices for players around the world.
