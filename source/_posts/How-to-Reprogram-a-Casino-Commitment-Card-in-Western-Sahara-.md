If you live in a country with a casino, but don’t have a commitment card, don’t worry – it’s easy to reprogram one for your use.

When visiting a casino, it’s important to remember that commitment cards aren’t just bound by the rules of the casino – they’re also bound by the laws of the country where they were issued. For example, in western Sahara commitment cards cannot be used to gamble on games of chance – only games of skill are allowed.
