In fact, the median hourly wage for casino dealers in the United States is $15.39 per hour, which is slightly higher than the national median hourly wage of $14.26 per hour. In addition, casino dealers only typically work about 30 hours per week, which means they earn a pretty decent salary considering they only work part-time.

So, how does an online casino dealer make money?

Well, online casino dealers typically earn a commission on the games they are dealing. For example, if a player places a bet of $10 on blackjack, the dealer may earn a commission of $0.50 for every hand played. This commission can add up over time and can be quite lucrative for dealers who are good at their job.

In addition to commissions, online casino dealers may also receive tips from players. This can be a great way to make extra money on top of your regular salary.

Overall, it is safe to say that casino dealers make a good living wage and that their hours are not as bad as most people think.
