#  MLS Commissioner Don Garber announces new guidelines for MLS expansion

On Wednesday, January 24th, 2018, MLS Commissioner Don Garber announced new guidelines for MLS expansion. The announcement came as part of a Press Conference at Columbia University in New York City.

Commissioner Garber began the Press Conference with remarks on the growth of soccer in the United States. He then went on to present the new guidelines for MLS expansion.

The key points of the guidelines are as follows:

* There will be two expansion teams in 2019 * There will be no more than 28 teams in MLS * The fee for an MLS expansion team has been increased from $150 million to $200 million * The number of teams that will be awarded in 2020 has yet to be determined * The priority for awarding teams will now be: city, market size, stadium plan & ownership group * Proximity to an existing MLS team is no longer a priority

These new guidelines have been put in place to ensure the quality and sustainability of MLS. In response to a question about how these guidelines might impact Miami's bid for an expansion team, Commissioner Garber said "We're going to work hard with David Beckham and Simon Fuller and his partners to try to make that work."
