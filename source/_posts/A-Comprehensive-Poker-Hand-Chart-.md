#  A Comprehensive Poker Hand Chart 

Poker is a game that has been around since the early 1800s. It is a popular card game that can be played in casinos or at home with friends. In order to be successful at poker, it is important to understand the different hands and their rankings. This comprehensive poker hand chart will help you do just that!

In poker, there are 10 ranks of hands: from best to worst, they are royal flush, straight flush, four of a kind, full house, flush,straight, three of a kind, two pair, and one pair.

The highest-ranking hand is the royal flush, which is made up of five cards of the same suit in sequence, such as 10♥ J♥ Q♥ K♥ A♥. The next best hand is the straight flush, which is made up of five cards in sequence of the same suit. A four of a kind is made up of four cards of the same rank, and a full house is made up of three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank.

A flush is made up of any five cards of the same suit, and a straight is made up of any five cards in sequence but not all the same suit. A three of a kind is made up of three cards of the same rank, and two pairs are two sets of two different ranked cards. Finally, one pair consists of two cards with the same rank.

#  The Mathematical Formula For The Exact Number Of Poker Hands 

In mathematics, the exact number of poker hands can be computed through a certain formula. There are 52! (or about 8x1067) different possible five-card poker hands. This can be computed by multiplying the number of ways to select 5 cards from a deck (C(52,5)) by itself. The product is then reduced using the factorial function (52!).

An easier way of computing the number of poker hands is through the use of binomial coefficients. The number of combinations for selecting 5 cards out of 52 is C(52,5) = 10,200. This can be written as:

P(52,5) = 10,200

We can also find the probability of any given hand using this formula. For example, if we want to find the probability of getting a flush, we would use this equation:

P(flush) = C(13,2) / C(52,5) 
= 1/221 
= 0.455%

#  Poker Hand Probability: How Many Possible Combinations Are There? 

If you’re a poker fan, you’ve probably wondered about the probability of getting different hands. After all, different hands mean different chances of winning.

But just how many possible combinations are there?

First, let’s take a look at the ranking of poker hands. There are 10 different hands in total, from the weakest (Ace high) to the strongest (a Royal Flush).

1. Royal Flush 
2. Straight Flush 
3. Four of a Kind 
4. Full House 
5. Flush 
6. Straight 
7. Three of a Kind 
8. Two Pair 
9. One Pair 
10. Ace High (or any other single card)

Now, let’s take a look at the number of possible combinations for each hand. This is determined by multiplying the number of unique cards in that hand by itself, then dividing by 2,63,54,000 (the number of possible hands). So for example, the Royal Flush has 10 unique cards, so there would be 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 / 2,63,54,000 = 624 possible combinations.

 Hand # of Combinations Probability (%) 
Royal Flush 624 0.00002% 
Straight Flush 37120 0.00011% 
Four of a Kind 1876880 0.00548% 
Full House 311584 0.00093% 
Flush 2097152 0.00639% 
Straight 1024000 0.00313% 
Three of a Kind 542880 0.00163% 
Two Pair 4270400 0.01280% 
One Pair 8388608 0.02515%

#  How Many Poker Hands Can You Expect To See? 

In a game of poker, the number of hands you can expect to see is influenced by a number of factors, including the number of players playing, the type of poker game, and the betting amount. In general though, you can expect to see between 40 and 60 hands in an hour-long game.

This estimate is based on calculations that take into account how often each type of hand is likely to be dealt. In games with fewer players, you'll see more hands per hour, while in games with more players, you'll see less. Similarly, in high-stakes games where the bets are higher, you'll see fewer hands per hour than in low-stakes games.

The most common type of poker hand is a pair, so it's no surprise that this is also the hand that is dealt the most frequently. In fact, if you're playing a game that uses only a standard deck of 52 cards, then you can expect to see a pair dealt about once every 13 hands.

Other than pairs, there are four other types of starting hands that are considered "high" – three types of straight and a flush. These hands are dealt less frequently than pairs, but still more frequently than the "low" hands such as two pairs or three of a kind. You can expect to see a high hand dealt once every 5 to 6 hands on average.

The rarest type of hand is two suited cards of different ranks (also known as a "scoop"). With only 4 possible combinations out of 2 x 13 = 26 cards, this hand is dealt only once every 13 x 4 = 52 hands on average.

#  What Are The Odds Of Getting A Specific Poker Hand?

The odds of getting a specific poker hand can be computed. Let's say you are holding and the community cards are . The odds of your getting a royal flush are (1 in 6,493,760).
