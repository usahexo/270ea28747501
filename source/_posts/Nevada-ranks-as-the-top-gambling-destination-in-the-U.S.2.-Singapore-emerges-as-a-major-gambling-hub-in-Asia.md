# 5. Macau continues to be a global powerhouse for gambling

Macau is known as the “Las Vegas of Asia” and for good reason. The tiny enclave on the southern coast of China has become a gambling powerhouse in recent years, overtaking Las Vegas as the world’s biggest gambling center.

According to the latest figures from the Macau Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau, total gaming revenue for Macau was $33.5 billion in 2017, up 18 percent from the previous year. Gaming revenue in Las Vegas was just $25.5 billion during the same period.

What’s behind Macau’s surging popularity?

The first reason is that Macau has a much larger population than Las Vegas. With a population of over 600,000, Macau is able to support a much larger gambling industry than Las Vegas, which has a population of just over 2 million.

Secondly, Macau offers a much wider variety of gambling options than Las Vegas. In addition to traditional casino games such as blackjack, slots and poker, Macau also offers casino games with exotic Chinese motifs such as baccarat and mahjong. These games are especially popular with Asian gamblers who account for the majority of Macau’s gaming revenue.

Finally, Macau is much closer to China and other major Asian markets than Las Vegas is to North America. This makes it easier for Asian gamblers to get to Macau than it is for them to get to Las Vegas.

Despite its growing popularity, Macau still has some problems that need to be addressed. One issue is that many of its casinos are owned by billionaire casino tycoons such as Sheldon Adelson and Steve Wynn who have been accused of using their casinos for money laundering and other illegal activities. Another issue is that Macau’s economy is very dependent on gambling revenue and is vulnerable to downturns in the global economy.

Nevertheless, Macau remains a global powerhouse for gambling and is likely to maintain its position as the top gambling destination in the world for many years to come.
