#  Who are the main rivals of Borussia Monchengladbach?

There are a few teams that could be considered as Borussia Monchengladbach's main rivals. One of these is Schalke 04, who are based in the same city. The two teams are typically fighting for the same places in the Bundesliga table, and matches between them are always hotly contested. Another team that could be considered as a rival is Bayern Munich. This is due to the fact that they are one of the most successful clubs in Germany, and Gladbach have not been able to compete with them on a regular basis. Finally, there is Bayer Leverkusen.
