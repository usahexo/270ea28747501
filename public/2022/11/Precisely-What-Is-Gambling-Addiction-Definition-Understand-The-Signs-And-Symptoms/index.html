Understand The Signs And Symptoms"></a>Precisely What Is Gambling Addiction Definition? Understand The Signs And Symptoms</h1><p>Gambling addiction definition is actually a compulsive habit of gambling that has unfavorable consequences in somebody’s life. This disorder is actually characterized by uncontrollable urges as well as impulses to gamble, despite the awareness of potential risks and damaging consequences. Indicators and symptoms of gambling addiction might include: chasing losses, hiding or lying about gambling, feeling restless or irritable when not gambling, jeopardizing or spending significant amounts of money on gambling, borrowing money from family and friends to finance gambling habits, depression or suicidal thoughts as a result of gambling losses. If you think you may have a problem with gambling, it’s important to seek professional help.</p>
<p>Similar to other addictions, gambling addiction is a disease that impacts both the mind and body. When someone is addicted to gambling, their brain releases dopamine in response to winning bets or anticipating a win. Dopamine is a feel-good neurotransmitter that reinforces the behavior, essentially causing the person to become “hooked” on the thrill of betting. As time goes on, the dopamine receptors in the brain become less sensitive to dopamine signals. This leads the gambler to need to place bigger and bigger bets in order to achieve the same level of pleasure, which can quickly lead to financial ruin. In addition, when someone is addicted to gambling they may also experience:</p>
<p>✓ Mood swings ✓ Paranoia ✓ Anxiety ✓ poor physical health ✓ social isolation ✓ legal problems</p>
<p>Recovery from gambling addiction requires professional treatment along with commitment from the individual affected. Treatment typically includes cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and/or medication management. CBT helps individuals learn how to identify and change thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to their addiction. Medication management may be necessary for individuals who also suffer from co-occurring mental health disorders such as depression or anxiety.</p>
